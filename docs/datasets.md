# Datasets

As part of our commitment to growing the game off the field, we aim to provide a new downloadable dataset of synchronized identifiers for players in the Division 1 leagues in the United States every season. By providing these foundational datasets, we hope that analysts across the country will be able to produce higher quality, better integrated reports and applications for their technical staffs and other stakeholders.
