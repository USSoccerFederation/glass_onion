# Datasets

As part of our commitment to growing the game off the field, we're providing downloadable datasets of synchronized identifiers for players, teams, and matches in the Division 1 leagues in the United States. By providing these foundational datasets, we hope that analysts across the country will be able to produce higher quality, better integrated reports and applications for their technical staffs and other stakeholders.

### Update Schedule

We aim to update these once a season.

### Accuracy

We've manually reviewed these identifiers for any errors after synchronization and are confident that these can be used reliably for analysis tasks. However, we're only human, so you see an error with an object's synchronized identifiers, please use the [Report a sync error workflow](https://github.com/USSoccerFederation/glass_onion/issues/new) in GitHub Issues.
