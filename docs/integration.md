# Integration

When building an object identifier sync pipeline, there are a bunch of other tasks that you may need to do that Glass Onion does not provide support for: deduplication, false positive detection, etc. Provided below is an abridged version of our (US Soccer) integration of Glass Onion into the data pipeline that powers our unified data schema. This is not meant to be the canonical implementation pathway -- just an example based on our environment and needs. Please let us know if you see ways in which we can improve this document (and therefore our implementation)!

## Prerequisites

## Step 1: Data Collection

## Step 2: Data Aggregation

## Step 3: Glass Onion

## Step 4: "Knockout" Logic and Flagging

## Step 5: Data Formatting
